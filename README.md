### Team Management  
1. Be careful about picking teammates, tell your idea and estimated time needed to commit as a team. Talk at least 30 minutes to make sure that the person you talk to can understand the problem correctly and have enough time to commit. At the end of the project, don't hire new teammates because the communication expense is expensive.  
2. Do not waste time to complain irresponsible teammates. Do things to the limit, get some results, and then set a precise seive, collaborate with responsible people who got results before. If can't get results, keep trying things to the limit, don't team up with someone just because of in a hurry of getting results.

### Work Method
1. Careful, loogical, and rigorous. In a competitive market, if do 99 things right and one thing wrong, users will remember the wrong one, and select other competitors.  
2. Be creative when looking for approaches, but only report results to boss.  
3. If not sure about the problem, ask it until clear.  
4. Dig the hidden reasons behind abnormal data.  Sometimes the data is wrong, needed to be update; Sometimes the meat of data analysis is there.
