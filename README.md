### Team Management  
1. Be careful about picking teammates, tell your idea and estimated time needed to commit as a team. Talk at least 10 minutes to make sure that the person you talk to can understand the probem easily and have enough time to commit. At the end of the time, don't hire new teammates because the communication expense is expensive.

### Work Method
1. Careful, loogical, and rigorous. In a competitive market, if do 99 things right and one thing wrong, users will remember the wrong one, and select other competitors.  
2. Be creative when looking for approaches, but only report results to boss.  
3. If not sure about the problem, ask it until clear.  
4. Dig the hidden reasons behind abnormal data.  Sometimes the data is wrong, needed to be update; Sometimes the meat of data analysis is there.
